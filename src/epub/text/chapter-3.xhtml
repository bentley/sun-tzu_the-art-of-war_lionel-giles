			<p id="p-1">1. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzǔ</span> said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-218" id="noteref-218" epub:type="noteref">218</a></p>
			<p>2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-219" id="noteref-219" epub:type="noteref">219</a></p>
			<p id="p-3">3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy’s plans;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-220" id="noteref-220" epub:type="noteref">220</a> the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-221" id="noteref-221" epub:type="noteref">221</a> the next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the field;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-222" id="noteref-222" epub:type="noteref">222</a> and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-223" id="noteref-223" epub:type="noteref">223</a></p>
			<p id="p-4">4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-224" id="noteref-224" epub:type="noteref">224</a> The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-225" id="noteref-225" epub:type="noteref">225</a> and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-226" id="noteref-226" epub:type="noteref">226</a></p>
			<p>5. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-227" id="noteref-227" epub:type="noteref">227</a> with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-228" id="noteref-228" epub:type="noteref">228</a></p>
			<p>6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-229" id="noteref-229" epub:type="noteref">229</a></p>
			<p>7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-230" id="noteref-230" epub:type="noteref">230</a> This is the method of attacking by stratagem.</p>
			<p>8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-231" id="noteref-231" epub:type="noteref">231</a> if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-232" id="noteref-232" epub:type="noteref">232</a></p>
			<p>9. If equally matched, we can offer battle;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-233" id="noteref-233" epub:type="noteref">233</a> if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-234" id="noteref-234" epub:type="noteref">234</a> if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.</p>
			<p>10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-235" id="noteref-235" epub:type="noteref">235</a></p>
			<p>11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-236" id="noteref-236" epub:type="noteref">236</a></p>
			<p>12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:⁠—</p>
			<p id="p-13">13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-237" id="noteref-237" epub:type="noteref">237</a></p>
			<p>14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier’s minds.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-238" id="noteref-238" epub:type="noteref">238</a></p>
			<p>15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-239" id="noteref-239" epub:type="noteref">239</a> through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-240" id="noteref-240" epub:type="noteref">240</a></p>
			<p>16. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-241" id="noteref-241" epub:type="noteref">241</a></p>
			<p id="p-17">17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-242" id="noteref-242" epub:type="noteref">242</a></p>
			<p>(2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-243" id="noteref-243" epub:type="noteref">243</a></p>
			<p>(3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-244" id="noteref-244" epub:type="noteref">244</a></p>
			<p>(4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.</p>
			<p id="p-17-5">(5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-245" id="noteref-245" epub:type="noteref">245</a> Victory lies in the knowledge of these five points.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-246" id="noteref-246" epub:type="noteref">246</a></p>
			<p>18. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-247" id="noteref-247" epub:type="noteref">247</a> If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-248" id="noteref-248" epub:type="noteref">248</a></p>
