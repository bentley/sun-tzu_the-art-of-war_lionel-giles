			<h3>Chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>. Energy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-273" id="noteref-273" epub:type="noteref">273</a></h3>
			<p>1. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzǔ</span> said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-274" id="noteref-274" epub:type="noteref">274</a></p>
			<p>2. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-275" id="noteref-275" epub:type="noteref">275</a></p>
			<p>3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy’s attack and remain unshaken⁠—this is effected by manœuvers direct and indirect.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-276" id="noteref-276" epub:type="noteref">276</a></p>
			<p>4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg⁠—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-277" id="noteref-277" epub:type="noteref">277</a></p>
			<p>5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-278" id="noteref-278" epub:type="noteref">278</a></p>
			<p>6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-280" id="noteref-280" epub:type="noteref">280</a> like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-281" id="noteref-281" epub:type="noteref">281</a></p>
			<p>7. There are not more than five musical notes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-282" id="noteref-282" epub:type="noteref">282</a> yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.</p>
			<p>8. There are not more than five primary colors,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-283" id="noteref-283" epub:type="noteref">283</a> yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.</p>
			<p>9 There are not more than five cardinal tastes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-284" id="noteref-284" epub:type="noteref">284</a> yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.</p>
			<p>10. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack⁠—the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of manœuvers.</p>
			<p>11. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle⁠—you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-285" id="noteref-285" epub:type="noteref">285</a></p>
			<p>12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.</p>
			<p>13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-286" id="noteref-286" epub:type="noteref">286</a></p>
			<p>14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-287" id="noteref-287" epub:type="noteref">287</a></p>
			<p>15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-288" id="noteref-288" epub:type="noteref">288</a></p>
			<p>16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-289" id="noteref-289" epub:type="noteref">289</a></p>
			<p>17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-290" id="noteref-290" epub:type="noteref">290</a></p>
			<p>18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-291" id="noteref-291" epub:type="noteref">291</a></p>
			<p>concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-292" id="noteref-292" epub:type="noteref">292</a></p>
			<p>masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-293" id="noteref-293" epub:type="noteref">293</a></p>
			<p>19. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-294" id="noteref-294" epub:type="noteref">294</a></p>
			<p>He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-295" id="noteref-295" epub:type="noteref">295</a></p>
			<p>20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-296" id="noteref-296" epub:type="noteref">296</a></p>
			<p>21. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-297" id="noteref-297" epub:type="noteref">297</a></p>
			<p>Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-298" id="noteref-298" epub:type="noteref">298</a></p>
			<p>22. When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-299" id="noteref-299" epub:type="noteref">299</a></p>
			<p>23. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-300" id="noteref-300" epub:type="noteref">300</a></p>
